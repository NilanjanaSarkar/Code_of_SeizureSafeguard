- ### Abstruct
This project aims to develop a wearable device that can detect seizures in epileptic patients through the real-time analysis of patient parameters such as EEG, heart rate, temperature, and involuntary jerking motions. The physiological data will be continuously monitored and recorded using sensors embedded in a wristband. Collected data will then be analysed using machine learning algorithms to detect abnormal patterns indicating the onset of a seizure. Once a seizure is detected, the device will alert caregivers or medical professionals on a connected mobile app. This project is expected to significantly improve the quality of life for epileptic patients by providing timely and accurate detection of seizures, allowing for prompt medical intervention. A log will be maintained enabling healthcare professionals to monitor patient progress and adjust treatment plans accordingly. The use of IoT technology in this project represents a promising advancement in the field of healthcare and has the potential to greatly benefit patients with epilepsy.

- ### Introduction
Epilepsy, a chronic noncommunicable neurodegenerative disorder, affects 50 million people of all ages worldwide. 1 It is characterised by recurrent seizures caused by abnormal electrical discharges in the cerebral region of the brain. A person with epilepsy has two or more unprovoked seizures that happen more than twenty-four hours apart. Depending on which areas of the brain are affected, an excessive spike in electrical activity in the brain during a seizure can result in a wide range of symptoms. Seizures can be broadly classified into three categories: generalised, focal, and epileptic spasms.
  - **Background and Significance of Epilepsy Detection using EEG** 
Epilepsy detection using EEG is a valuable technique that involves recording and analysing the electrical activity in the brain. This method helps doctors diagnose epilepsy and understand the pattern and characteristics of seizures. By studying the EEG signals, healthcare professionals can identify abnormal brain activity and determine the type and severity of epilepsy. This information is crucial for prescribing appropriate medications, implementing treatment strategies, and improving the overall management of epilepsy. It allows for a more precise and personalised approach to care, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals living with epilepsy. EEG allows detection of a large spectrum of seizure types, even those without motor and autonomic features.2 The EEG signal of an epileptic patient can be segmented into four sections, namely pre-ictal (before seizure), ictal (during seizure), post-ictal (after seizure) and inter-ictal (between seizure episodes). The pre-ictal and inter-ictal stages are key sections in predicting seizure onset.
  -  **Objectives**
In our project, we aim to create an automated system for seizure detection using IoT. The objective is to develop a device that can continuously monitor and analyse various physiological signals and movement patterns in individuals with epilepsy. By leveraging IoT technologies such as wearable devices or sensors, the system will collect real-time data from these individuals. This data will then be processed and analysed using advanced machine learning algorithms. The system will be trained to recognize specific patterns or changes in the collected data that indicate the occurrence of a seizure. Once a seizure is detected, the system will generate timely alerts to notify caregivers or medical professionals. This will allow for immediate intervention and assistance, potentially reducing the risk of injury or complications during a seizure. Seizure detection devices also allow objective tracking of frequency of seizures, allowing healthcare professionals to evaluate response to therapy and appropriately adjust medications
